we can use pipedream to automate workflow
for ex we want to have english dubbing on our hindi video
flow->
-->set trigger when ever we upload a video
--> download the mp4 video and send the video to chat gpt api as request body to convert video to txt
--> chatgpt sends the response as txt and then we send txt to  elevenlabs api to convert to txt to speech(english)
--> after speech is received mail to the editor that voice is ready to get dubbed
